    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges in the field of quantum information is solving strongly-correlated many-body systems. The identification of the entanglement structure as well as the time and temperature evolution of some observables have direct applications in many fields such as condensed matter physics or quantum chemistry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Direct approaches of these systems are usually intractable due to the strong correlations between particles or the exponential growing of the complexity as more particles are taking into account. On the other hand, a huge variety of analytical and numerical techniques have been proposed in the last century; for instance, Tensor Networks [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2164)] is one of the most used in the last years due to the variety of applications. But, although could be very accurate, are still approximations to the quantum states of the systems studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes we are lucky and there exist a technique that allows us to solve some models _exactly_; these are the so-called _exactly-solvable models_ and most of them have a long tradition in statistical mechanics. Some examples are the 1-_d_ and 2-_d_ Ising Model, _XY_ model and the Bethe ansatz to solve Heisenberg-type models.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there exist an analytic method to diagonalize and, therefore, solve these models, what if we can construct a quantum circuit that implement these methods and _disentangle_ certain kind of hamiltonians? This idea was proposed by Vestraete, Cirac and Latorre [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1888)]: they designed a circuit that disentangles the _XY_ hamiltonian. As a consequence, one have access not only to the ground state of the system, but also to all its spectrum: this is fundamental to understand and study all properties of the model, including time and temperature evolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the emergence of quantum computers such as IBMQ, the real implementation of these circuits become possible. In this notebook, the most simple circuit will be programmed and implemented: a $n=4$ transverse Ising spin chain. We will compute the magnetization of the ground state and the time evolution (at zero time!) of some spin state."

    "## The transverse Ising model\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most simple models to describe an interacting spin chain is the transverse Ising model, which is a particular case of the $XY$ model. It describes an spin-1/2 chain with nearest-neightbour interaction with an external magnetic field. The hamiltonian of this model is usually written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sigma^{x}_{i}\\sigma^{x}_{i+1} + \\lambda\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sigma^{z}_{i},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the strength of the external magnetic field, and $\\sigma$ are the Pauli matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma^{x}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}0&1\\\\1&0\\end{array}\\right),\\qquad \\sigma^{y}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}0&-i\\\\i&0\\end{array}\\right),\\qquad \\sigma^z{}=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{array}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model shows a quantum phase transition at some critical point $\\lambda=\\lambda_{c}$: for $\\lambda<\\lambda_{c}$ the spins are in a disordered paramagnetic phase (spins desire to be antiparalel $\\uparrow\\downarrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\cdots$) and for $\\lambda>\\lambda_{c}$ the spins are in an ordered ferromagnetic phase (spins desire to be in the same direction, $\\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\cdots$ or $\\downarrow\\downarrow\\downarrow\\downarrow\\cdots$). For infinite chains, $\\lambda_{c}=1$. For finite chains with periodic boundary conditions, i.e. spin $n$ interacts with spin 1, the critical point is lesser than 1, but approaches to the value of infinite chain as $n$ increases. The same happens with the entropy: the bipartite entropy peaks around critical point, which moves to $\\lambda=1$ as the size of the chain increases and scales logarithmically following the conformal scaling law $S\\sim \\frac{c}{6}\\log n$ with central charge $c=1/2$ [[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.1499)].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magnetization\n",
    "\n",
    "One natural measure to observe the quantum phase transition is the magnetization, which corresponds to the expected value of the spin operator \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle S_{i}\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\langle\\sigma_{i}\\rangle $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As in our model the magnetic field is applied in the $z$ direction, we will measure the transverse magnetization, i.e. $M\\propto\\langle\\sigma_{z}\\rangle$ (moreover, we will take natural units and set $\\hbar=1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvectors of $\\sigma_{z}$ operator are \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\\sigma_{z}|\\uparrow\\rangle &=& +1|\\uparrow\\rangle, \\qquad \\sigma_{z}|\\downarrow\\rangle &=& -1|\\downarrow\\rangle \\end{eqnarray},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we will identify them with the computational basis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}|0\\rangle&\\equiv&|\\uparrow\\rangle=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}1\\\\0\\end{array}\\right), \\qquad\n",
    "|1\\rangle&\\equiv&|\\downarrow\\rangle=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\1\\end{array}\\right) \\end{eqnarray}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What should we expect from the magnetization as $\\lambda$ increases? Let's set $\\lambda=0$: all spins interact with their first neighbors according the above hamiltonian, i.e. in the $x$ direction, which is orthonormal to the $z$ direction. Following the above convention for the computational basis, the eigenstates of $\\sigma_{x}$ are\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{array}{l l}\n",
    "\\sigma_{x}|\\rightarrow\\rangle=+1|\\rightarrow\\rangle, & |\\rightarrow\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|\\uparrow\\rangle+|\\downarrow\\rangle\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle\\right), \\\\\n",

    "\\end{array}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for no external magnetic field, the spins point in the $x$ direction ($\\rightarrow\\rightarrow\\rightarrow\\cdots$ or $\\leftarrow\\leftarrow\\leftarrow\\cdots$) and as the magnetization is the expected value of $\\sigma_{z}$ (the mean value of +1 spin states and -1 spin states), it is essentially zero. But when $\\lambda$ appears, it introduces a direction in the orientation of spins, and they start flipping in order to align with the external field. This phenomena increase the magnetization until all spins are aligned: as many spins are considered, the transition is more abrupt.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, computing the magnetization is computing the expected value of $\\sigma_{z}$, _i.e._ $\\langle\\sigma_{z}\\rangle=\\langle\\psi|\\sigma_{z}|\\psi\\rangle$. As we have assigned $+1$ the magnetization of $|0\\rangle$ state and $-1$ the magnetization of the $|1\\rangle$ state, for a $N$ spin state\n",

    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will set $t_{0}=0$ and $|\\Psi(t_{0})\\rangle\\equiv|\\Psi_{0}\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the stationary states basis (eigenstates of the hamiltonian),\n",

    "\n",
    "Then, if none of the above cases are fulfilled, the expectation value of $\\mathcal{O}$ will oscillate according to the frequencies $(E_{n}-E_{m})$.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Time evolution operator\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take advantage of our circuit to implement the time evolution in a very easy way: we only need to compute the time evolution operator over our diagonalized hamiltonian and then apply the $U_{dis}$ gate to transform it into the Ising state. As the eigenstates of $\\tilde{H}$ are the states in the computational basis, the time evolution operation consists only to add the corresponding phase $e^{-itE_{n}}$ over the chosen state:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We choose some initial state written in terms of the $\\tilde{H}$ basis $$ |\\Psi_{0}\\rangle = \\sum_{i}c_{i}|\\psi_{i}\\rangle. $$ A linear combination of eigenstates is also an eigenstate, so $|\\Psi_{0}\\rangle$ is a stationary state of $\\tilde{H}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We apply the time evolution operator over this state $$ |\\Psi(t)\\rangle=e^{-it\\tilde{H}}|\\Psi_{0}\\rangle= \\sum_{i}c_{i}e^{-it\\epsilon_{i}}|\\psi_{i}\\rangle. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we stop here and compute the magnetization, it will be constant, as we are evolving a stationary state... in terms of $\\tilde{H}$ basis, but $|\\Psi_{0}\\rangle$ will not be necessarily an eigenstate of the Ising hamiltonian!\n",
    "\n",
    "3) We implement the $U_{dis}$ gate to transform the state to the Ising basis $$ |\\Phi(t)\\rangle= U_{dis}|\\Psi(t)\\rangle= U_{dis}\\sum_{i}c_{i}e^{-it\\epsilon_{i}}|\\psi_{i}\\rangle. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, $|\\Phi(t)\\rangle$ is not, in general, an eigenstate of the Ising hamiltonian, so we expect to observe an oscillating time evolution of magnetization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point here is that to implement the time evolution over a computational state is very easy, as we only need to add a phase over the qubits involve. Let's see a particular example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: time evolution of $|\\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\rangle$ state\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to observe the time evolution of the state of all spins align in the positive direction of $\\sigma_{z}$. This is not an eigenstate of Ising hamiltonian, since \"all spins aligned\" is a degenerate state (all spins up or all spins down). First we need to know what is the corresponding state in the diagonal basis (remember that we choose $|\\uparrow\\rangle\\equiv|0\\rangle$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |\\psi_{0}\\rangle=U^{\\dagger}_{dis}|0000\\rangle=\\cos\\phi|0000\\rangle+i\\sin\\phi|1100\\rangle , \\qquad \\phi=\\frac{1}{2}\\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2}}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we compute the time evolution of this state, _i.e._ we add the corresponding phases $e^{-it\\epsilon_{i}}$, where $\\epsilon_{i}$ are the energies of the states $|0000\\rangle$ and $|1100\\rangle$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |\\psi(t)\\rangle=e^{-it(-2(\\lambda+\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2}))}\\cos\\phi|0000\\rangle+ie^{-it2(\\lambda-\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2})}\\sin\\phi|1100\\rangle = e^{2it(\\lambda+\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2}))}\\left(\\cos\\phi|00\\rangle+ ie^{4it\\sqrt{1+\\lambda^2}}\\sin\\phi|11\\rangle\\right)\\otimes|00\\rangle,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we can forget the first exponential since it only introduces a phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that to prepare this state is only necessary to make a rotation on the first qubit followed by a CNOT; the other two qubits are prepared in the $|0\\rangle$ state, which is very convenient.\n",
    "Once we have $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$, we can apply $U_{dis}$ and compute the expected value of the magnetization."
